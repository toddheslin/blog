Most of the books I've *read* are Audible audio books. I seem to have not developed a sufficient attention span to read for more than 30 minutes, but I can quite happily listen to an audiobook for hours on end. 🤷‍♂️

Here are my favourites in no particular order. I'll add more thoughts on each someday:

- [Pretty much every book] by Seth Godin
- Thinking Fast and Slow — Daniel Kahneman
- Models — Mark Manson
- The Tao of Seneca — Seneca, produced by Tim Ferriss
- Thinking in Bets — Annie Duke
- The Mom Test — Rob Fitzpatrick
- Permanent Record — Edward Snowden
- Essentialism — Greg McKeown
- Fooled by Randomness — Nassim Taleb
- The Black Swan — Nassim Taleb
- A Guide to the Good Life — William B. Irvine
- The Course of Love — Alain de Botton
- Confessions of an Economic Hitman — John Perkins
