ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Todd, a full stack web developer living in Wellington, New Zealand. I build tools and apps for the web, mostly using Vue, Node, and Hasura. Check my setup [here](/uses).

I grew up around Sydney, Australia and was living in Singapore before moving to New Zealand in 2019. My career started with studying economics and practicing accounting + corporate finance. I started my first business in the [ESG](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-criteria.asp) sector before it was cool. We grew a team of ten talented engineers, saved a whole bunch of industrial energy, then I sold up to move onto the world of tech.

After all, I was still in my early 20's at the time.

I started doing some product management for a few startups, moved onto making stuff using no-code tools (before it was called no-code) and eventually taught myself programming. I haven't stopped building stuff since.

Maybe the easiest way to understand me is to see how little I put on my plate. I work best on a rough schedule with only two or three things 'planned' for the day.

My week usually looks like this:

--- Monday ---
- Watch the MotoGP race from early hours of the morning (when in season)
