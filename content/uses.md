## Stack of choice
I've been a Javascript developer for my whole career as a programmer. It was a programatic choice when starting out — I wanted to build entire web applications with minimal learning curve. Whilst Javascript has it's quirks, I love it as a general purpose programming language for building the types of things I build.

I've been a reluctant convert to Typescript, mostly because I found most TS code examples to verbose and show display all sorts of misdirection. When I reflected on this resistance a bit longer, I realised that I dislike most javascript code that other people write too. So maybe it's just me?

Here is my goto stack for any web application:

- Bulma + Buefy — sensible css defaults + application components
- Vue / Nuxt — sorry Team React fans
- Fastify — completely underrated Node.js web/API framework
- Hasura - the most unbelievable open source application ever
- Postgres - yay elephants

And I'd be disingenuous if I didn't mention that this site is build with Hugo and I've built on the minimal theme of [Noteworthy](https://github.com/kimcc/hugo-theme-noteworthy) (thanks @kimcc!).

### Dev tooling
- Taskfile
- GenQL
- Docker compose

### Hosting
I do my best to support hosting companies that aren't giant tech monopolies. Yet, between Google's GCP and Amazon's AWS, I pick GCP every time. Every time I've tried to do something basic in AWS, I end up spending hours doing very *AWS sort of things*.
